/*
The u (unicode) flag enables full Unicode support in the regular expression.

By default, JavaScript and regex treats 4-byte Unicode characters (like emojis or less common symbols) 
as two separate 2-byte "surrogate" code units.

The u flag treats the pattern as a sequence of Unicode code points, which is important for correctly 
handling characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
